The TAs are going to receive hundreds of 3 pages of 10 pt font single space assignments, they're not going to read it word for word. For the midterms (2 separate days of 2 questions out of 4, so one day one question, the other day another), Jasso is going to choose it by random. He crumbles up papers with the question numbers on them, makes students switch it around, and reveals it in front of the class. With all this entertainment, the midterm and the final (that's during week 10, but choosing 2 out of 5 questions) only allow for 30 minutes of writing time.

This is an all Excel class and it teaches you how to use it in realistic situations with businesses. It's a pretty challenging class - almost all of the homework is about 1 to 3 problems, and you have to apply what you learned in lecture to these problems. On the first day you'll be able to assign yourself to a group on a spreadsheet - there will be two group presentations every lecture to go over the homework problems. The professor walks you through the logic of the homework problems but you'll have to set up Excel yourself. He gives you a template in PDF form so you can't copy and paste it onto Excel, but you have an idea of what you have to do.

At first, it was annoying that he sends out about 5 emails reminding you to do the web assignment before the first lecture (basically a ~15 minute survey for every class that relates to the lesson - he collects the students' stats to present in class). The professor is pretty lenient with the web assignments being submitted a little bit late, but that's not the case for the write ups. In the class besides the web assignments, there are 5 write-ups (with assigned readings ranging from like 5 to 15 pages, a big one being 30ish) in total that you need to do out of 8 offered in 10 weeks. The first two write ups (counted as 1) is with a randomly assigned group and was 600 words each. The rest, you are free to chose as long as you have done 5. There's no midterm and only a final - the final you have the option to go solo or choose a partner/have the professor choose one for you. The final is about a case study with 6 questions and all he tells you is that you have to use class concepts for it. You have 5 days to complete it and it had a word limit of 2000. The professor is great, he makes every topic interesting and has a lot of opportunities for extra credit throughout the quarter. Should basically be a pretty easy A class as long as you make the effort to do the web assignments and write ups. They're due every Thursday but if you turn it in the Sunday before, you get an extra credit point added to your score. I'd really recommend this class as an elective!

Clickers are questions that we had about one minute to answer during lecture and we did between 2 and 7 for every lecture and discussion. They make up 20% of your grade, so if you don’t understand a concept or don’t answer in time, you’re screwed, the bottom 20% of your scores from clickers are dropped. Group homework is done for the most part during discussion, and the questions have little to no relevance to the current course material. The midterm is 30% of your grade, and you really need to know your diagrams and graphs. If you do well on the practice midterm, you basically don’t have to do the actual midterm because he takes the higher score. The final is a short 10 minute oral final with two other people. It isn’t terrible if you know all your terms and diagrams, but he just tells you to study the slides so it's frustrating to study for - this is 10% of the grade. Online homework is assigned almost daily and at random times, so you have to keep checking if he posted the homework.

The lab final focused a lot on the material from experiments 1-5 in my opinion (chair structures, IR spectra, acids and bases are the main topics I can think of).

For the first one, you're making a quiz on Thunkable so you might have to attend office hours for some extra help.

DON'T CHEAT! My friends got caught. He puts specific things in the template to catch the cheating.

The HW was pretty easy and even if you have the wrong answer, as long as you gave a credible, honest working to your solution, they'll assume you did it right and give you full marks.

I rated this a 7 mainly because of how Web Development is in the real world where technologies are quick to rise and quick to die meaning that there are a multitude of concepts and stacks to learn. \\n\\nI came in with about 3 years of previous web dev experience and I was able to tackle all quizzes, labs, and final project fairly easily but if you have no experience whatsoever, it will be pretty hard because of the sheer amount of concepts that you need to learn on the fly and apply to your labs.\\n\\nFor example, lab 1 was a simple static mock twitter page. Lab 2 and 3 extended on lab 1 by adding in data fetching, sorting, and live updates from a JSON file. Lab 4 was about building a real time chat app using express and handlebars which imo was outdated technologies and it should've been taught with web sockets.\\n\\nOn top of these labs, you have a final project where you are tasked with building any website as long as you implement some sort of fairly complex features. The default project is building a fully functional Social Media web app that allows a user to perform all the CRUD operations along with dynamic profile pages, commenting, uploading images, search bar, sessions, and user email/password.\\n\\nOverall though it was the most interesting class I took (albeit because I want to go into web dev) but  Professor Mariam Salloum was a wonderful and accommodating professor.

The cumulative grade was made up of 4 quizzes (10% each) , 5 homework (4% each) assignments and a final (40%). I think most people in my class can agree that she does a poor job at teaching the class. She speeds through the powerpoint, and changes homework questions the night before assigning them ( from last years hw questions ), leaving some problems very difficult to solve since she hasn't worked out the answers yet. For one homework assignment she even had to change a homework question 3 times because she didn't check the difficult of it beforehand. A lot of the hw questions are very vague and require meeting with a TA to understand how to solve. In terms of quizzes, she give a quiz 'syllabus' and 'sample' quizzes for each quiz, which is nice, but the material on the actual quizzes were very different than the sample ones. She actually gives quite a bit of extra credit for the quizzes though, so keep that in mind. Usually in class, she'll give you a timed ~5min problem than you can choose to answer for extra credit ( 1-2 points ) that gets added to the next quiz. At the end of the quarter she also give an extra credit quiz worth ~9 quiz points, if you can prove a few of the really challenging proofs she goes over through the course. In total, the amount of extra credit you could potentially get was close to 15 points which is 50% of a quiz grade ( out of 30 points normally ). The final was on the difficult side, with the average around 60% but she slightly curves it, so that the average is around 65/70%.

Didn't mean I did good though cause I couldn't do the majority of hw problems without online help.

This is a group project class. If you don't already plan to take this class with people you know you may already have an increased difficulty. Overall the class is basically \\\"make anything\\\" and present it at the end of the class. The lectures are basically a repeat of what you've learned from other classes like CS 100.

The first lab is in React.js so you'll more than likely choose that to work with. \\n\\nFor those who don't know anything about web dev stuff make sure to get a team that does because tbh it's to late to learn a lot of this stuff. Web dev consists of HTML, CSS, JS/React, and some back end Server stuff. There is no way you'll learn all of this in this semester. You either already know some of this or you'll just be a drag to you're team mates. I suggest learning as much as you can before taking the course. Try the site Codecademy. They have HTML,CSS, and React lectures for free.\\n\\nI rated this class a 6 because I already knew HTML,CSS and had a very rough understanding of React.

Don’t forget to participate on the weekly discussion posts because it’s very easy to forget, and some easy points to lose if you don’t do them. Attendance isn’t mandatory for the class, but you should go to the sessions where you have to learn your dance piece to see what is expected of you regarding your dance video projects.

The midterms are based on the homework, but he switches the questions slightly (ex: \\\"increase\\\" from homework to \\\"decrease\\\" on midterm). It's basically a class with a lot of accounting stuff. He came up with a group project the Monday before Thanksgiving break, so we had to find group members outside of class and not within our discussion. So many people sent out emails to find a group and other members, so it probably delayed a lot of people in starting it. Since it was so last minute I thought it was pretty disorganized - I'm pretty sure no one wants to finish up a project during their break. The final ended up being based on the project, so just doing your part in the project probably wouldn't have been enough to know everything. It was decided that he was going to take the 3 best grades out of 2 midterms, the project, and the final. So make sure you do well on at least 3 of those. I think it's a class worth looking at, but the best experience would be going to lecture and actually knowing all the material for the group project if he decides to do it again.

He's very very meticulous with how he wants his assignments done and it was fairly overwhelming for a majority of the class for at least the first half of the quarter. He has a strange personality, but you can tell he's extremely passionate about his students and his career, often staying hours after his office hours to individually help his students. Three take home essays (with a crazy amount of prep time for each), one in-class essay, essay final, a few homework assignments that are basically just research and prep for your essays, and some group quizzes. You are allowed to skip the final IF you are doing well in the class (I think A's in essay 1+2) and you get at least an A- for the in-class essay. He sometimes gives opportunities to redo an essay (for a slight penalty) if you did particularly poorly or missed some key criteria required for said essay. The essays are graded pretty harshly and he is a stickler on sentence structure and grammar, but going to office hours and asking for his advice on your essay is the best way to get a good grade. Not a lot of reading other than some pages from the textbook occasionally and one pretty good book. He does make you watch some movies in the last half of the quarter, but you can do that on your own time and it's one movie a week basically. Most of his class revolves around teaching students the basics of writing and how to use the library/other sources properly. Throughout the quarter, he guides you through the process of how to write/prep the essays, especially the first essay, and he doesn't just expect a multiple page essay out of nowhere. The weeks leading up to an essay due date will be almost exclusively used for teaching you how to approach a certain type of essay or how to use a database to get research information for your essay and etc. Almost every lecture is tailored into helping your assignments out in some way. Having complex sentences and flow in your essays will get you a high grade. His class is certainly not an easy A, or even an easy B, but an A is absolutely achievable. If you want to actually take to heart what is being taught and genuinely want to become more proficient in English, take his class.\",\n    sentiment:0.4000000059604645,\n    magnitude:7.099999904632568\n },\n {\n    id:1182,\n    name:\"ENGL001B\",\n    rating:\"4.94\",\n    review:\"Avoid Benedict Jones AT ALL COSTS.

Lecture and discussion are usually on the same day and attendance is mandatory. Lecture is early in the day and covers the basis of the bees and beekeeping. Although, the professor does upload the lecture slides, they are not helpful at all. I suggest going to lecture and taking notes because he is more of a verbal person. Discussion is solely based on student presentations about scientific articles. Since it is the only thing covered on that day, the presentations are a big part of your grade. However, the professor and TA know that the majority of the students who take this course are not CNAS majors. So they understand if someone has difficulty doing the reading and the presentation and won't hold it against you. For lab, you get to explore the bees habitat (which is the fun part) you get to suit up in a beekeeper suit and work with the bee hives. The TA, other beekeepers from the lab, and Bar and his wife (who is also an entomologist) are present to help students. At the end of the course, you get to make honey and beeswax candles to take him as goodies. \\nThere is a midterm that was take home.

The only \\\"difficult\\\" thing might be the group project. We have a choice to do a skit in class or through a video, so a majority did the video. As Korean 1, you only learn the very basic grammatical structures, so the video, if a more fun/creative idea (ex: Kdrama parodies), it requires you to speak in sentences we wouldn't have been able to learn. Using Google translate would probably be okay but it'd be obvious and wouldn't sound too great to the professor. The professor is super lenient with the video so just have fun with it.

They are mostly 5-10pg articles and they average about 7 different articles A WEEK. The exams are reading heavy so you have to read the articles to do well. 2. The TAs are absolutely useless. It sucks enough that all lectures are recorded so you have no contact with the professor. My TA took an average of 1 week to respond to my emails, which would be too late anyway. The only actual class time is during discussion and most of the TAs for this class will straight up say to not ask them about the material because they don't have time to look at it. For exams, they tell you to do the reading, give you a study guide of what they think will be on the exam and call it a day. 2. There are 4 midterms and 1 final exam. Basically, there is an exam every other week on Fridays, so be careful about what classes you might have on Fridays. 4. The assignments are tedious and boring and the TAs grade harshly for things like citations, grammar, word count, etc. If you go over or under the word requirement, you will get points deducted. 5. The professors are not empathetic. A peer of mine got sick with covid and was in the hospital. When they let the professor know since they missed an assignment, the professor said that they should have told him sooner and the student received a 0 on the assignment.

She gave us 5 choices for IDs and made us write a paragraph of its definition and why the concept is important for 4 of them.

As an honors student this class was required W20 for first-years and it was insufferable. Even if the material was relatively easy, the workload was sometimes insurmountable in terms of reading and assignments - this is one of those classes where the professor acts like it's your only class and you don't have 2 or 3 others you're also doing readings and writing papers for. Dr. Lucia obviously knows what she's talking about and is esteemed in her field but sometimes acts as though we should already know half of the information she is presenting to us. She picks favorites and can be quite condescending. We also spent like 2 weeks on Native American religion but only 2 on Hinduism/Buddhism combined - of course there's only so much you can teach in 10 weeks but I felt that a lot of it was fairly disproportionate for a class about myth and ritual. Lecture was alright but discussion was based on Socratic seminar which I absolutely hated because attendance and participation (ie. speaking) were mandatory.
